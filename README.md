# predicting-real-estate-prices-in-california
Data Science project seeking to help homebuyers navigate the current housing market.

Using 2021 California real estate data, I wanted to find a better way for homebuyers to navigate the housing market.
Built using Python (various libraries), linear regression, and K-nearest neighbors.
Performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering to prepare data for machine learning modeling.
Compared two models tested, found that the KNN model outperformed the linear regression model.
